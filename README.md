# Tasks Repository

A monorepo containing multiple projects and technical exercises.

## Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a separate project or task:

- **factorySpace/** - Robot Control Interface with Gemini AI integration

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains its own README with specific setup instructions. Navigate to the project folder you want to work with and follow its README.

## Contributing

Each project is independent. When adding a new project:

1. Create a new folder with a descriptive name
2. Add a README.md in that folder explaining the project
3. Update this main README to list the new project
4. Follow the security guidelines (never commit .env files, API keys, etc.)

## Security

- Never commit `.env` files or API keys
- Each project should have its own `.gitignore` if needed
- Review `git status` before committing
